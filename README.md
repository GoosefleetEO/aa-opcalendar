## Usage
Before you are able to create new events on the front end you will need to setup the needed categories and filters for your events.

- Go to the admin site
- **Add a Host**. The first host is most likely your own alliance/corporation/community. Fill in at least the name ie. your alliance name. This name will be displayed on the calendar view on the event block. You may fill in additional information which will be displayed on the detailed view for the event.
- **Add visibility**. Event visibilities will determine who will be able to see the events. You can limit visibilities to groups or auth states.
- **Add a category**. Next you will need to add at least one category for your events. Categories can be whatever you want to have such as STRATOP, mining, roam etc. The ticker for the event will be displayed both on the calendar view event block and on the detailed view for the event.
- **Webhook for discord notifications (optional)**. If you want to receive notifications about your events (created/modified/deleted) on your discord you can add a webhook for the channel in discord you want to receive the notifications to. Add a webhook and connect it to the fleet signals.
- **Add new event**. To add new events simply go to the operation calendar and click on the add event button. Fill in the information for your event.


### Importing NPSI fleets
Opcalendar has  the ability to import predetermined NPSI fleets directly into your calendar. These operations will be labeled as `imported` operations.

Opcalendar is currently supporting imports for the following NPSI fleets:

- Spectre fleet
- Eve University (classes only)
- FUN INC

To start importing fleets:

- **Go to admin panel and select NPSI Event Imports**
- **Create a host** for each import and fill in the needed details for them.
- **Add a new import** by pressing on the add event import button
- **Select the source** where you want to fetch the fleets.
- **Determine operation type** for each fetched fleet.
- **Determine operation visibility** for each fetched fleet.

To schedule the import runs either add the following line in your local.py file or set up a perioduc task for the `opcalendar.tasks.import_all_npsi_fleets` task on your admin menu to fetch fleets every hour.

```
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['import_all_npsi_fleets'] = {
    'task': 'opcalendar.tasks.import_all_npsi_fleets',
    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*'),
}

```

### Importing fleets from ingame calendar
You can import events that have been created in the ingame calendar. As the fields on the ingame calendar are limited the events will not be as detailed as when created directly from the calendar.

1. Give the add_ingame_calendar_owner role for the wanter groups
2. Navigate to the opcalendar page and press the `Add Ingame Calendar Feed` button
3. Log in with the character that holds the calendar
4. Set up the view permissions for your members
5. Add the following line into your local.py setting file or set up a periodic task for the `opcalendar.tasks.update_all_ingame_events` to pull fleets from ingame every 5 minutes.

```
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['update_all_ingame_events'] = {
    'task': 'opcalendar.tasks.update_all_ingame_events',
    'schedule': crontab(minute='*/5'),
}
```
